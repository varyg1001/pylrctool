[00:30.99]Put me to the test
[00:32.58]And then push me trough this life
[00:35.06]Don't be afraid
[00:36.85]There's nothing you could do to make me run away
[00:40.22]Baby, we got so many memories to make
[00:43.96]Oh, I can feel it when you call me by my name
[00:47.41]By my name
[00:49.19]Don't be afraid
[00:50.97]But if I ever try to hide or run away

[00:57.99]And I don't know if I could ever live this way again
[01:01.83]But I got so many reasons I should stay
[01:04.86]Oh, oh
[01:07.17]And I don't know if I could ever live this way again
[02:21.97]Oh, oh
[02:25.62]Oh, oh
